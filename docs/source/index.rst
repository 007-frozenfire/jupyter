Jupyter Documentation
=====================

The Jupyter Notebook is a web application for interactive data science and
scientific computing. Using the Jupyter Notebook, you can author engaging
documents that combine live-code with narrative text, equations, images, video,
and visualizations. By encoding a complete and reproducible record of a
computation, the documents can be shared with others on GitHub, Dropbox, and
the `Jupyter Notebook Viewer <https://github.com/jupyter/nbviewer>`__.

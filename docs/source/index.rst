Jupyter Documentation
=====================

The Jupyter Notebook is a web application for interactive data science and
scientific computing.

Using the Jupyter Notebook, you can author engaging
documents that combine live-code with narrative text, equations, images, video,
and visualizations. By encoding a complete and reproducible record of a
computation, the documents can be shared with others on GitHub, Dropbox, and
the `Jupyter Notebook Viewer <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/>`__.

The main documentation for Jupyter users is organized into several sections:

  :ref:`User Documentation<user-docs>` |
  :ref:`Jupyter Subprojects<jupyter-subprojects>` |
  :ref:`About Jupyter<about-docs>`

:ref:`Developer Documentation<dev-docs>` covers how to help with the
development of Jupyter as well as technical details helpful for development.

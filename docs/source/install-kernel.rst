==============================
*Optional*: Installing Kernels
==============================

Installing the Jupyter Notebook will also install the
`IPython <https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ :term:`kernel` which
allows working on notebooks using the Python programming language.

To run notebooks in languages other than Python, such as R or Julia, you will
need to install additional kernels. For more information, see the full
`list of available kernels`_.

To install extra Python kernels, to make both Python 2 and 3 available in
Jupyter, or to set up kernels in environments, see the IPython docs on
`installing kernels <https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/kernel_install.html>`_.

Contributor Guides
==================

Whether you are a new, returning, or current contributor to Project
Jupyter's subprojects or IPython, **we welcome you**.

Project Jupyter has seen steady growth over the past several years, and it is
wonderful to see the many ways people are using these projects. As a result of
this rapid expansion, our project maintainers are balancing many requirements,
needs, and resources. We ask contributors to take some time to become familiar
with our contribution guides and spend some time learning about our project
communication and workflow.

The Contribution Guides here and project specific contributor information,
which is found in the individual project repos, offer helpful tips and
guidance. If you have a question, please ask us. `Community Resources
<https://jupyter.org/community.html>`_ provides information on our commonly
used communication methods.

We are very pleased to have you as a contributor, and we hope you
will find valuable your impact on the projects. **Thank you** for
sharing your interests, ideas, and skills with us.

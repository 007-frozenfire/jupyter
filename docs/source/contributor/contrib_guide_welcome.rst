Welcome

Whether you are a new, returning, or current contributor to Project
Jupyter's subprojects or IPython, **we welcome you**.

Project Jupyter has seen strong growth over the past several years, and it is
wonderful to see the many ways people are using these projects. As a result of
this rapid growth, our project maintainers are balancing many  requirements,
needs, and resources. We ask contributors to take some time to become familiar
with our contribution guides and spend some time learning about our project
communication and workflow.

The contribution guides here and project specific Contributor information,
which are found in the individual project repos, offer helpful tips and
guidance. If you have a question, please ask us. `Community Resources
<https://jupyter.org/community.html>`_ provides information on our commonly
used communication methods.

By fostering respectful, courteous participation within the projects, we
believe that Project Jupyter will thrive and evolve to meet community needs.
On a personal note, we ask you to be mindful in your communication with
others as well as focusing discussions on the issues and not the individuals
involved.

We are very pleased to have you as a contributor, and we hope you
will find valuable your impact on the projects. Again, **thank you** for
sharing your interests, ideas, and skills with us.

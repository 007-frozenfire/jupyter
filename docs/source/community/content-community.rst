Community Guides

Welcome to the Community Guide for Jupyter. This section try to introduce many
of the Jupyter-related topics, event, etc, and we welcome any contribution to
it. As our community is highly dynamic, information there can become out of
date quickly. Feel free to tell us when this is the case, or if anything is
missing.


Weekly Dev meeting
------------------

The core developer have weekly dev-meeting to request help, or discuss things
that happen recently, as well as bootstrap conversation. We try to keep the
meeting short. These meeting are public and posted on the `IPython channel
<https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUuzz1eYiKIzu_Uw1ZQLNoQ>`_ on YouTube.

You will find there two kinds of meetings, the ``IPython/Jupyter``  ones
– usually at 9am Pacific time on Tuesday – that are broad topic, and the
``JupyterLab`` ones – usually 9am Pacific Time on Friday –  which are more
focused on the current evolution of the Jupyter Notebook. These meeting are not
live broadcast for technical reasons, but we are always looking for a better
technologies, so if you have any advice, please let us know.

Collaborative notes are taken before/during the meeting on
https://jupyter.hackpad.com  [a real-time markdown-like editor] which contain
the daily link to the video meeting (if you want to join live), but the
attendance is limited to 10 people, after which the video conferenced becomes
unsustainable.

Too keep Hackpad responsive we use 1 Hackpad / month. You can see the list of
all Hackpads  on https://jupyter.hackpad.com.

24 to 48 hours before each meeting we will ping the following Gitter channel to
know who is likely going to attend:

https://gitter.im/jupyter/dev-meeting-attendance

If not enough people are available, we usually just cancel the meeting. This
channel also get a link to the recorded upload on YouTube, and has a
last-resort technical difficulty to join the meeting one.
Feel free to hangout there if you want to join us.

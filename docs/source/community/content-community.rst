Community Guides
================


Welcome to the Community Guides for Jupyter. These guides are intended to
provide information about the Jupyter community such as background, events,
and communication channels. As our community is highly dynamic, information
may change, and we will do our best to keep it up to date.

Weekly Dev meeting
------------------

The core developers have weekly meetings to discuss and demo what they have
been working on, discuss future plans, and bootstrap conversation. These
meetings are public. The direct link to attend the meeting will be posted to
the `Hackpad <https://jupyter.hackpad.com>`_ before the meeting. Afterwards,
the recording of the meeting will be posted to the `IPython channel
<https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUuzz1eYiKIzu_Uw1ZQLNoQ>`_ on YouTube.

**Jupyter/IPython meetings:**

- Tuesdays at 9am PST

**JupyterLab meetings:**

- Fridays at 9am PST

Collaborative notes are taken before/during the meeting on
`Hackpad <https://jupyter.hackpad.com>`_. Hackpads are organized by month.

We will ping the `dev-meeting-attendance Gitter channel <https://gitter.im/jupyter/dev-meeting-attendance>`_
1-2 days before each meeting to know who is likely going to attend.

What is a Jovyan?
-----------------

You may see the word **Jovyan** used in Jupyter tools (such as the user ID in the
`Jupyter Docker stacks <https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks?`_ or referenced in
conversations. But what is a Jovyan?

In astronomical terms, the word "Jovian" means "like Jupiter". It describes
`several planets that share Jupyter-like properties <https://www.universetoday.com/33061/what-are-the-jovian-planets/>`_.

Much like the planet Jupiter and our solar system, the Jupyter community
is large, distributed, and nebulous. We like to use the word **Jovyan** to
describe members of this community. Jovyans are fellow open enthusiasts that use, develop,
promote, teach, learn, and otherwise enjoy tools in Jupyter's orbit. They make up the
Jupyter community. If you're not sure whether you're a Jovyan, you probably are :-)

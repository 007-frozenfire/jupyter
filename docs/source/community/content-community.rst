Community Guides

Welcome to the Community Guides for Jupyter. These guides are intended to provide information about the Jupyter community such as background, events, and communication channels. As our community is highly dynamic, information here can become out of
date quickly. Feel free to tell us when this is the case, or if anything is
missing.

Weekly Dev meeting
------------------

The core developers have weekly meetings to discuss and demo what they have been working on, discuss future plans, and bootstrap conversation. These meetings are public. The direct link to attend the meeting will be posted to the `Hackpad <https://jupyter.hackpad.com>`_ before the meeting. Afterwards, the recording of the meeting will be posted to the `IPython channel
<https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUuzz1eYiKIzu_Uw1ZQLNoQ>`_ on YouTube.

**Jupyter/IPython meetings:**

- Tuesdays at 9am PST

**JupyterLab meetings:**

- Fridays at 9am PST

Collaborative notes are taken before/during the meeting on
`Hackpad <https://jupyter.hackpad.com>`_. Hackpads are organized by month.

We will ping the `dev-meeting-attendance Gitter channel <https://gitter.im/jupyter/dev-meeting-attendance>`_ 1-2 days before each meeting to
know who is likely going to attend.

Blog
====

We publish on `blog.jupyter.org` using the Ghost blog platform. Here are some
guideline and warnings for authors using our blog platform either regularly, or
as guests. 

If you have any doubt, ask someone that have already published, some things
cannot be easily undone. 

You want to publish something on our blog ? Feel free to ask us, tell us what
you want to write about. Hope fully it's Jupyter related ! We are always happy
to get new content. If you don't feel comfortable writing on your own, we can
alway help you to write you post. 


Insertion of images:
--------------------

Try not to link to external images, if you want to put an image in the post,
insert ``![]()`` in the editor and drag and drop from your desktop into the new
created field. External images can change, and can break the blog post if they
are taken down, if you drag and drop images they will be served from the same
Content delivery network as the blog, which will insure the best experience for
our readers.

The image you see at the  top of our blog posts are set from within the
metadata field, not using the `![]()`. They are treated differently that
inlined images by many feeds reader (especially on mobile) and allow user on
slow connection  to read the content of the blog earlier, which is a much
better experience.  


Links
-----

Do not use minified links when possible, the multiple redirect of minified
links make the Mobile browsing experience a pain. If you need analytics of
number of page view, this is tracked by Google analytics. 


Posts Title
-----------

Alway check in the metadata fields that a blog post has a title and a canonical
URL, is possible put the date in the canonical URL, in particular for events
like jupyter-day, that can occur several time. The date of the even can differ
from the date of the blog post. 

Once you publish a Post, **never** change the title or the url, as it will
break links of tweets, and RSS feeds. Keep in mind that when publishing some
platform cache the url immediately, so changing the title will leads a lot of
people to hit a 404 page. 

Posts Updates
-------------

People that are subscribe to the blog might receive notification at every
update of the post that is made. So use updates and fixes parsimoniously.
It is OK to wait a few hours to fix a typo. 

Always ask for a review
-----------------------

Once you think you are done, ask someone else to reread your post, and check
the various parameters that you might have forgotten before publishing. 
You are not on your own, this is teamwork !
If we do things in a hurry you will probably spend more time fixing mistakes 
that actually doing things right in a first place.

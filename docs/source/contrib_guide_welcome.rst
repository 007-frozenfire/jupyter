Welcome

Welcome. Whether you are a new, returning, or current contributor to Project
Jupyter's subprojects, such as Jupyter Notebook, or language kernels, like
IPython, we welcome and appreciate your contributions.

Project Jupyter is a quickly growing group of projects. Our project
maintainers are balancing many requirements, needs, and resources. We ask
contributors to take some time to become familiar with our contribution
guides and spend some time learning about our project communication and
workflow. The contribution guides here and project specific Contributor
information are helpful in getting started. If questions arise, please ask us.
`Community Resources <https://jupyter.org/community.html>`_ provides contact
information.

By fostering a respectful, courteous participation, we believe that the 
projects will thrive and continue to fulfill the evolving community needs. On
a personal note, we ask you to be reflective on your communication with
others as well as keeping discussions about the issues and not the individuals
involved. 

We are very pleased to have you as a contributor, and we hope you
will find valuable your impact on the projects. Again, **thank you** for
sharing your interests, ideas, and skills with us.

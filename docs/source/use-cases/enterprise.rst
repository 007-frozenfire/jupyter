Description
-----------

Businesses, especially those that started their ‘digital transformation’ journey, are producing ever-increasing volumes of data. Enterprise data science aims to unearth the hidden value of those digital assets, which are typically siloed, uncategorized, and inaccessible to humans.

Jupyter and JupyterHub can play a major role in related initiatives, especially in companies with an established open-source culture. The intent of this page is to provide you with ideas how Jupyter technology can fit into *your* organization's processes and system landscapes, by providing real-world examples and showcases.

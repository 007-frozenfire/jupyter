Contributing to the Jupyter Blog
================================

We publish our blog at `<https://blog.jupyter.org>`_. We welcome ideas for posts
or guest posts to the Jupyter blog. If you have a suggestion for a future post,
please feel free to share your idea with us. We would like to discuss the idea
with you.

Do you enjoy writing? Please contact us about becoming a guest blogger. We can
help guide you through the process of creating a post.

Technical overview
------------------
Jupyter's blog uses the Ghost blog platform for its contributor flexiblity and
ease of use. Jupyter's blog is deployed at `<https://blog.jupyter.org>`_.

Basic workflow from blog idea to published post
-----------------------------------------------
There are several major steps in the workflow from blog idea to a published post
including:

* Creating a draft
* Draft Review
* Editorial acceptance
* Publishing the post

We'll cover each of these as well as how to update a post once it has been
published.

Creating a draft
----------------

Insertion of images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Try not to link to external images, if you want to put an image in the post,
insert ``![]()`` in the editor and drag and drop from your desktop into the new
created field. External images can change, and can break the blog post if they
are taken down, if you drag and drop images they will be served from the same
Content delivery network as the blog, which will insure the best experience for
our readers.

The image you see at the  top of our blog posts are set from within the
metadata field, not using the `![]()`. They are treated differently that
inlined images by many feeds reader (especially on mobile) and allow user on
slow connection  to read the content of the blog earlier, which is a much
better experience.  

Links
~~~~~

Do not use minified links when possible, the multiple redirect of minified
links make the Mobile browsing experience a pain. If you need analytics of
number of page view, this is tracked by Google analytics. 

Posts Title
~~~~~~~~~~~

Alway check in the metadata fields that a blog post has a title and a canonical
URL, is possible put the date in the canonical URL, in particular for events
like jupyter-day, that can occur several time. The date of the even can differ
from the date of the blog post. 

Once you publish a Post, **never** change the title or the url, as it will
break links of tweets, and RSS feeds. Keep in mind that when publishing some
platform cache the url immediately, so changing the title will leads a lot of
people to hit a 404 page. 


Draft review
------------
Ask for a review
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you think you are done, ask someone else to reread your post, and check
the various parameters that you might have forgotten before publishing. 
You are not on your own, this is teamwork !
If we do things in a hurry you will probably spend more time fixing mistakes 
that actually doing things right in a first place. 

Editorial acceptance
--------------------

Publishing the post
-------------------

Changing an existing post
-------------------------

Posts Updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

People that are subscribe to the blog might receive notification at every
update of the post that is made. So use updates and fixes parsimoniously.
It is OK to wait a few hours to fix a typo.

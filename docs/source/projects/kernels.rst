Programming Languages (Kernels)
===============================

The IPython :term:`kernel` is maintained by the Jupyter team since the
IPython kernel is used when creating and running the Jupyter notebook server.

Many other language kernels are maintained by the community.
Please see the `list of available kernels <https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/IPython-kernels-for-other-languages>`_
and `kernel installation instructions <https://ipython.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install/kernel_install.html>`_.
